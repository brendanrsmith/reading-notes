# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Describe “The Cloud”

Internet-connected computers which allow for on-demand resource availability and virtually unlimited scale.

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

Containers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. Like virtual machines, containers allow you to package your application together with libraries and other dependencies, providing isolated environments for running your software services.

### What is auto-scaling?

Auto-scaling is a cloud service that monitors your application and automatically provisions resources based on use requirements, essentially using the principle of just-in-time manufacturing.

### What is bandwidth?

The speed at which two computers are able to share information.

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?

They charge based on a factor of `(time service ran) * (computing power used)`

## Terms

**Server Instances** - A single virtual machine running on a single cpu

**Containers** - a self contained software package environment that handles running a given set of code.

**Cloud Services** - the various services provided by a cloud service provider. Many to choose from including runtime environments, storage facilities, automation, etc.

**Cloud Architecture** - the entire chain of cloud services used by a given project.

**AWS** - Amazon Web Services, kind of the kleenex of cloud services.

**EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku** - Heroku is essentially a third-party GUI for the AWS EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk services.
