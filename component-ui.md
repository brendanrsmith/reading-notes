### Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

While both a library and a framework interact with your code in similar ways, they differ in *inversion of control*. While a library provies you code tools to use while you control the flow of the application, a framework handles the flow of the application and allows you to pass in some code to certain places.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Rendering** - the process of a browser pasing js, css, and html code into the DOM in order to display a web page to a user. Essentially, the browser can simply compile HTML, but must actually 'run' JavaScript code in order to display it. 

**Templates** - tools that allow you programatically compose HTML in a JavaScript context.

**State** - a variable describing the current status of a given object or part of a program.
