# CSS Grid
> In the same way that flexbox gave us a way to layout block elements next to each other, CSS grid lets us not only arrange elements in a row or a column, but in multiple rows and columns.

Grid is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. 
It is 2-dimensional, unlike flexbox. 
Grid is applied both to parent (*Grid container*) elements and children (*Grid item*) elements.

Grid is actually designed for layout from the ground up. Phew. 

how-to: 
  `<div class="container">
    `<div class="item item-1"> </div>
    `<div class="item item-2"> </div>
    `<div class="item item-3"> </div>
  `</div>
