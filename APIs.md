## REST
>  REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
computers can use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other

For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page.
Http is a general purpose protocol for applying verbs (actions) to nouns (resources)

RESTful web frameworks utilize polymorphic actions and universal subjects to simpllify interacting with different resources.
