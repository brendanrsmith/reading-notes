## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

Redux Toolkit is a full opinionated library for managing and organizing redux development. Ducks is simply an organizational paradigm for how to lay out the file structure of a redux project for efficient scaling and maintenance.

### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

It speeds up the development process by providing boilerplate code, and enforces best practices with redux organization.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**redux toolkit slices** - A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. [src](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice/)

**namespace** - a set of signs that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified. [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace)
