# Pair Programming 
pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.
Two roles: 
- driver handles typing, mechanics, and writing
- navigator communicates theory, error-checking, direction.

Learning programming is a lot like learning a langugage, with reading, speaking, and writing
Pair programming is often more efficient than single-person due to earlier caught errors and better navigation
##Synergy
Also called engaged collaboration

The paired process also encourages other learning modalities, builds social skills, and prepares you for paired job interview processes. 

# JQUERY 
*JQuery* is a JavaScript library that allows simplified syntax.
The `jQuery()` selector is often called with `$()` and can find elements using CSS-style selectors.

It can also append methods to those objects `('selector').method('parameter');`

jQuery allows you to do common tasks in less code than vanilla JavaScript. 

A returned querey object is called a *matched set* or a *jquerey selection*.

Methods can both get and set data.

jQuery objects store references to elements, not copies of the elements. This is good! 

*Implicit iteration* allows you to loop through all matching objects in a query. 

*Chaining* allows you to attach multiple methods on a single selection.

## Methods
`each()` loops a selection of elements
  `this` or `$(this)` allow you to access the element 
 `.on()` handles event methods
