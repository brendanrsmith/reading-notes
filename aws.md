# AWS Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

A client wants to access or utilize resources on a server. The client makes a `request` to the server, containing some information about what resource they want to access. The server, listening for these requests, can then do any necessary processing, and provide a `response` to the client. Using this cycle, we can manage what and how the client and server communicate to each other.

### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

In this context, a server is simply any computer program which listens for requests from a client, and provides some response to that client.

### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

To make an application available to a server and therefore accessible on the web.

## Terms

**Server** any computer program that provides functionality to other programs or devices, known as 'clients'

**Pub/Sub** Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events. [src](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview)

**WRRC** Web Request Response Cycle: the cyclical relationship between clients and servers on the internet. Begins with a client request to a server, and is followed by a server response back to the client.

**Amazon EC2** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud: a cloud computing service that provides virtual machines capable of running web servers, over the internet.

**Elastic Beanstalk** web service that deploys, manages, and scales web apps and services. Handles system admin tasks completely.
