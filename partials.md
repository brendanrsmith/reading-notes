# Partials
partials allow you to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. 
They work sort of like functions, and allow you to propigate changes across all the pages on a server. 

We will store these parials in `views/partials/` directory, as .ejs files. 

  <%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>
Easy as pie!
